# European_Hotels_Group-A_thorough_Data_Analysis

# Project Summary
 * The European Hotels Group has always believed that the best way to maximize its 
revenue is to have a number of hotel properties, in a variety of settings, to 
accommodate a wide range of travellers. They currently have hotels located in cities 
and resort locations.
The new owners are not certain this is the correct business strategy for the future, 
and have hired us to analyze their data. They are interested in how understanding 
each property is performing individually over time, and to compare how each 
property is performing compared to the other over time.
We have been provided with 2 comprehensive data sets, one being a hotel dataset 
and another being a resort dataset and we, as data analysts, use various 
visualizations and models to generate meaningful insights from the data provided 
with a view to provide strategic recommendations to the European Hotels Group with 
a primary view to increase ADR.


# Business Questions
* How does customer turnout vary with seasons?
* How can we avoid cancellations? 
* How does ADR differ with different attributes?
* Which countries do the majority of our customers come from?
* How can we improve revenue taking cancellations into perspectives?
* Does the time span between booking date and arrival/cancellation date follow a pattern? Also, how relevant is it?.
